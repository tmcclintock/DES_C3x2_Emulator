# DES_C3x2_Emulator
This repository contains the code relevant to constructing an emulator for the covariance matrix used in the 3x2pt analysis. This only contains code used in the analysis and *cannot contain any DES data*, so please be careful what you commit. For this reason, there will be hard-coded paths to any data and the scripts found here won't work out of the box.
